# Parts-of-Speech-Tagging-for-data-preprocessing-using-NLP
<h2><b>Note:- I have developed this Project entitled "Parts of Speech Tagging for Data Pre-Processing using NLP" with Flask mainframe API and python programming
language. It shows the sentence polarity and subjectivity values obtained with the help of package - "TextBlob", "nltk".</b></h2>
<h3><b>Overview</b></h3><br>
POS tagging is a process of categorizing each word in a sentence into nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, conjunctions and determinants. Various Machine Learning
algorithms basic model depends on preprocessing of text. My proposed approach use lateral entries in the dictionary along with their information. Here, it mainly
depends on the frequency of occurrence of words in the dictionary.<br>
<h3><b>Existing System</b></h3><br>
We live in an era of digital technology enhancement, still identifying POS Tagging is much more difficult when compared to matching words to their independent parts
of speech via a dictionary method. It is quite different to sense that one word has two or more meanings based on their reference and the context they are being used.
It is difficult to individually classify and assign the parts of speech for words manually. Thus new types of words keep building up in the dictionary, as POS depends
on pre trained data it is not capable of scaling to newly introduced words.<br>
<h3><b>Proposed System</b></h3><br>
The objective of this paper is to increase automaticity and maintain high precision, while limiting the size of human made corpus. In my current work we approach the
task of POS tagging as an optimization problem.<br>
